# Simple ATM
When I took my first computer science course we were tasked with creating a simplified ATM program that would allow a user to do a few things:
- Check the user's balance
- Deposit into a user's account
- Withdraw from a user's account
- Validate a user's credentials
- Lock a user out if too many attempts were used in trying to access a user's information

And so I wanted to improve not only the runtime but also the readability and space comlexity of the program.
